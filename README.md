# Rat in a Maze - Constraint Satisfaction Problem using Backtracking
The project utilizes the backtracking algorithm to solve the CSP efficiently.

## Description

The "Rat in a Maze" project is a terminal-based simulation of a classic constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) where a rat needs to find its way through a maze from the starting point to the end point while satisfying certain constraints. The project utilizes the backtracking algorithm to solve the CSP efficiently.

## Features

- **Maze Generation**: Generate a random maze of a specified size.
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Navigate the maze while following constraints such as not traversing through walls and reaching the end point.
- **Backtracking Algorithm**: Employ the backtracking algorithm to efficiently search for a solution to the maze.
- **Solution Display**: Display the optimal path that the rat took to reach the end point in the terminal.

## Usage
1. Run the main script::

   ```
   python Rat_in_a_maze.py
   ```
